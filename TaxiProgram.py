"""Write a program which keep track of details for a taxi. The program should
start off by asking for the driverâ€™s name. It should then repeatedly ask to
start a new trip. If the user says "yes", ask for the time the trip took in
minutes. It should print out the cost at the end of the trip which is a base
cost of $10 plus $2 extra for each minute the trip took.
